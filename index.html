      Hey, do you remember that letter I gave you last year? The one where I told you how much you inspired me, how you made me believe I could change my life? I promised you I’d prove it—that I wouldn’t just say it, but actually do it. Well, you did your job. You changed me. Truly. So much that the people around me noticed. They saw the difference, they felt it, and they started praising me for the person I’ve become. And it’s all because of you. You made me want to be better, and I can’t thank you enough for that
